# CSS Animation practise

In this exercise I attempted to animate a ferris wheel. It's not 100% what I'd want. I wanted the individual cars to rotate around given spokes, but I do prefer this, then having the cars rotate together as a group. I also let the balloons bounce a little, and added a fade between day and night.
